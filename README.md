# Students Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict students' performance using various machine learning regression models. Each model was trained and evaluated based on its ability to predict student scores accurately.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered and preprocessed data to prepare it for machine learning models.

2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implemented several regression models including Lasso Regression, K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor, XGBRegressor, and AdaBoost Regressor.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated each model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R2 Score on both training and test datasets.

### Model Performance

- **XGBRegressor**:
  - **Accuracy:** 97.71%

This project demonstrates effective use of machine learning techniques to predict students' academic performance, aiding in educational planning and intervention strategies.
